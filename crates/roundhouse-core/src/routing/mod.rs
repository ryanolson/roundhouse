//! Routing: putting local workers and frontier models on one comparable axis.
//!
//! The problem this layer solves is that "serve this turn from our own Llama on
//! worker 7" and "send it to Anthropic" are not obviously comparable. They
//! become comparable once both are expressed as *cache-adjusted expected
//! prefill*, plus latency, price, and a quality prior.
//!
//! The two sides get that number very differently:
//!
//! - **Local** — Dynamo's selection service answers directly. `POST /select` is
//!   query-only and returns `effective_prefill_tokens`, the scheduler's own
//!   cache-credit-weighted prefill cost, without booking anything. That is
//!   already the currency we want.
//! - **Frontier** — no provider exposes its cache, so we *model* it from the
//!   routing ledger: what we last sent to that target, when, and under which
//!   provider TTL. See [`ledger`].
//!
//! Costing happens in `roundhouse-fleet`, which owns the transports. This
//! module owns the vocabulary and the choice.
//!
//! [`RoutingPolicy`] is the seam that keeps Switchyard optional. Its
//! `Algorithm` trait is a good fit — the algorithm emits `Step::CallLlm` with a
//! semantic target and the *host* executes it — but `libsy::State` is in-memory
//! with no pluggable persistence, which collides with surviving process death.
//! Keeping libsy behind this trait means our session core never depends on it.
