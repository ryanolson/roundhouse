# Documentation

This book is the documentation of Roundhouse. The source is in `docs/src/`. A GitHub Actions workflow builds it and publishes it to GitHub Pages on each push to `main`.

## Where text goes

| Text | Place |
|---|---|
| How a subsystem works, and why | A chapter in this book |
| Measured numbers, with their setup | A chapter under Operations |
| Rejected designs and negative results | A chapter under Development |
| The reason for a line of code | A short code comment |
| A hard lesson ("X breaks when Y") | A test. Its doc comment can be long. |
| Plans, work in progress, session notes | `agent-docs/` on a work branch. **Never merged to `main`.** |

## Rules

- **`agent-docs/` never merges to `main`.** Use it for notes while work is in progress. Before the PR merges, move the lasting parts into this book and delete the directory from the branch.
- **Keep only what lasts.** Write how it works, why, the numbers with their setup, and the results that did not work. Do not copy plans, phase or workstream labels, PR numbers, or handoff notes. History is in git.
- **Write in simple English.** Use the `simple-english` skill for the book, README files, and comments.
- **Keep comments short.** A comment says why, or which fault the code avoids. It does not repeat the code.
- **Update the book in the same PR.** Each PR that changes behavior updates the chapters that describe it and the top-level `README.md`.
- **Name the revision of an external claim.** A statement about how Codex, Claude Code, NeMo Relay, Switchyard, or Dynamo behaves names the version or commit it was read from. When the pin moves, read the claim again.

## Build the book locally

Install the tools at the versions that CI uses:

```bash
cargo install --locked mdbook --version 0.4.52
cargo install --locked mdbook-mermaid --version 0.16.2
cargo install --locked mdbook-linkcheck --version 0.7.7
```

Build the book and check its links. This is the command that CI runs:

```bash
bash scripts/build-book.sh
```

A broken internal link fails the build.

The build script also installs the mermaid assets. After one run of it, preview while you edit:

```bash
mdbook serve docs --open
```
